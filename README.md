# Quantitative-Stock-Portfolio-Advisor


## About
The Quantitative Stock Portfolio Advisor is a data-driven application designed to construct a diversified stock portfolio that closely tracks benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and TSX 60. Using financial metrics such as beta, tracking error and correlation, ranking algorithms, and optimization techniques, the tool selects and weights stocks to achieve maximum alignment with market performance. The output includes the final optimized portfolio worth $1,000,000 CAD, its correlation with the benchmark, and detailed performance metrics about each stock.

## Try It Out!

1. **Download the Files**:  
   Download the `.ipynb` and `requirements.txt` files from the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Run the following command in the terminal (with `requirements.txt` in your root directory):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create the Input File**:  
   Prepare a `.csv` file containing a single column of stock tickers you wish to include. This file will serve as the input for the program and should match the format of `Tickers.csv` in the repository.

4. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   Ensure you have a Python environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks or a similar platform to run the `.ipynb` file.

5. **Run the Notebook**:  
   Open the `.ipynb` file in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) and execute the cells.

## Output
The program will generate a file named `Final_Portfolio.csv`, which contains the selected stocks and their optimal weights in the portfolio.
